The most prevalent theft involves malware that infects a business computer workstations and laptops.   Once installed, the malware provides the information that enables the cyber thieves to impersonate the business in online banking sessions.  To the Bank, the credentials look just like the legitimate user.  The cyber thieves use the sessions to initiate these funds transfers to the bank accounts of associates within the U.S.  These accounts may be newly opened by accomplices or unwitting money mules for the express purpose of receiving and laundering these funds.  The accomplices or mules withdraw the entire balances shortly after receiving the money, and then send the funds overseas via over the counter wire transfer or other common money transfer services. The corporate account takeover scheme relies on money mules for the final transfer of funds out of the U.S.","ACH Operations - Corporate Account Takeover","Bank personnel review ACH accounts for the following activities which may preclude an account takeover:   
1.  A new account opened by an individual consumer with a small deposit, followed shortly by one or more large deposits by ACH credit or wire transfer;  
2. An existing account with a sudden increase in the number and dollar amount of deposits by ACH credit or wire transfer; 
3. A new or existing account that withdraws a large amount of cash shortly after a large deposit by ACH credit or wire transfer (often 5 to 10 percent less than the deposit because the mule has withheld a commission).   

Additionally, The Bank has implemented the following measures to mitigate the risk of corporate account takeovers:  
1. Multi-factor and multi-channel authentication for business accounts that are permitted to initiate funds transfers;  
2. Require business customers to initiate payments under dual control, with distinct responsibility for transaction origination and authorization; 
3. Enable out of band confirmation of payment initiation, or for out of pattern payments;   
4. Provide out of band alerts for unusual activity (red flag reports);  
5. Establish and monitor exposure limits that are related to customers activities;
6. Use of all available fraud detection and risk management services for its ACH operators (such as a threshold or a cap on ACH credit origination that alerts personnel to irregular origination activity);  
7. Educate business customers on a periodic basis regarding the prevention, detection and reporting measures, including, but not limited to, instructing them to: 
     A. Initiate ACH and other transfer payments under dual control when possible (such as one person authorizes the creation of the payment file while a second person authorizes the release of the file);  
     B. Ensure that all anti-virus and security software and mechanisms for all computer workstations and laptops that are used for online banking and payments are robust and up to date;  
     C. When possible, restrict functions for computer workstations and laptops that are used for online banking and payments (such as a workstation used for online banking should not be used for general web browsing and social networking).  A better solution is to conduct online banking and payments activity from a dedicated computer that is not used for other online activity, and/or is not connected to an internal network;  
     D. Monitor and reconcile accounts on a daily basis to recognize fraudulent activity as soon as possible; and 
     E. Utilize routine and red flag reporting (i.e., alerts about unusual activity) for transaction activity.","Convene incident response team with specialists/experts to determine the reasons for the compromise.
